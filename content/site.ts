  narrative: `Daive and Abra's story began with a simple Facebook connection sometime between 2018 and 2019. What started as casual chats quickly turned into a beautiful friendship, filled with shared stories, late-night talks, and constant support through life's ups and downs.

Along the way, they discovered a shared sense of humor, a deep understanding of each other, and a love for life's simple joys. In a loud and busy world, they found comfort, warmth, and a safe space in one another.

Built on mutual respect, genuine care, and lots of laughter, their love continues to grow with every adventure they take together. Today, they're excited to celebrate this special moment with you—grateful for the journey that brought them here and excited for all the adventures still ahead.`,
